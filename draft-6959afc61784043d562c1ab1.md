For this project, I decided to host an open-source version of [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) on my Raspberry Pi. I’d want to provide a straightforward way to get this up and running on your instance as well. Before I begin, I wanted to share the backstory of how I started on this journey and some of the lessons I'I'veearned. I first came across the [Vaultwarden repo](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) sometime in the summer of 2025. After watching a YouTube tutorial, I decided it was something I could do, even though I was a newbie (to an extent, still am). I attempted to run the script right there in the README:

```yaml
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN="https://vw.domain.tld" \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

It worked! I was able to see the login screen when I navigated to the resource and the specific port, but I was not able to access anything, as you can see in this screenshot here:

I searched the internet for a while but was unable to spend the time reading in-depth in the early months, and I decided to move on to other projects, such as Portainer and SterlingPDF, among others.

## What I did next

I came back to this project at the end of 2025 around New Year's weekend. I tweaked the `Docker Compose` file with the following. This is an actual copy of my code.

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:alpine
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: always
    environment:
      DOMAIN: "https://pass.example.com"  
      SIGNUPS_ALLOWED: "true" # Deactivate this with "false" after you have created your account so that no strangers can register
      ADMIN_TOKEN: ${ADMIN_TOKEN}
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data:/data # the path before the : can be changed
    ports:
      - 11001:80 # you can replace the 11001 with your preferred port
```

Note: A DOMAIN is required to make this work as is, and this is where I believe I encountered issues the first time around. I was trying to access Vaultwarden using HTTP, which Vaultwarden does not support. So, a domain is required when using a reverse proxy; your domain, Vaultwarden, needs to know it's HTTPS to work correctly with attachments.

Another thing I had to remember is that on Raspberry Pi OS, you cannot use the `image: vaultwarden/server:latest` image. I ran into this issue and had to consult our AI friends reluctantly on how to fix it. It must be `image: vaultwarden/server:alpine`; everything else, where you put the data, and even the ports, is up to you.  
I ran the container with `docker compose up -d` and also `docker logs -f vaultwarden` . This part is optional, but I included it to check for any errors that may have occurred. It's important to note that this is where I deviate from the many tutorials on how to use Caddy or Nginx Proxy Manager. I chose Cloudflared because I already created a tunnel for my [nocodb project](https://hughj.dev/nocodb). I learned quite a bit about CF tunnels, and I wanted the same solution.

In my first project, I installed CF tunnel via the CLI, and now I wanted to use the Cloudflare One Dashboard this time around. I had already registered my domain with CF, and I logged into CF One.

In the Zero Trust Platform, locate and click on "N" tworks.”

Under Networks, navigate to “Manage Tunnels” and set up a tunnel if you don't already have one. It's pretty straightforward, and I won't go into too much detail on how to do it.

From here, you need to manage the routed host names as I have done here:

Now, I’ve just entered something here as a demonstration, but a few things will happen. Cloudflare will automatically create a CNAME record within the DNS management.

And that’s it, in a few seconds, you’d be able to navigate to your resource. And this can be done for almost anything running on a port on your machine. I prefer this method to opening ports on my machine, which can cause some security issues. Cloudflare Tunnels establishes an outbound-only connection to applications and leverages the extensive Cloudflare network.

I will create another post about generating the keys to securely enable the Admin page at another time.
