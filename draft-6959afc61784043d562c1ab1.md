For this project, I decided to host an open-source version of [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) on my Raspberry Pi. I wanted to give others a straightforward way to get this running on their own setup too. Before diving into the steps, I want to share how I got here and what I learned along the way.

I first came across the [Vaultwarden repo](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) sometime in the summer of 2025. After watching a YouTube tutorial, I figured it was something I could handle, even though I was still pretty new to Docker at the time. I tried running the script directly from the README:

```yaml
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
  --env DOMAIN="https://vw.domain.tld" \
  --volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 \
  vaultwarden/server:latest
```

It worked. I was able to see the login screen when I navigated to the resource and port. But I could not actually access anything, as you can see in this screenshot:

I searched around for a while but did not have the time to dig deeper in those early months. I eventually moved on to other projects like Portainer and SterlingPDF.

## What I did next

I came back to this project at the end of 2025 around New Year's weekend. This time, I updated the setup and used Docker Compose. Here is the actual file I used:

```yaml
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:alpine
    container_name: vaultwarden
    restart: always
    environment:
      DOMAIN: "https://pass.example.com"
      SIGNUPS_ALLOWED: "true" # Set to false after creating your account
      ADMIN_TOKEN: ${ADMIN_TOKEN}
    volumes:
      - ./vw-data:/data
    ports:
      - 11001:80
```

A quick but important note. A DOMAIN is required for this setup. This is where I ran into trouble the first time. I was trying to access Vaultwarden over HTTP, which Vaultwarden does not support. When you are using a reverse proxy, Vaultwarden needs to know it is behind HTTPS so that attachments and WebSockets work correctly.

Another key point for Raspberry Pi OS. You cannot use `image: vaultwarden/server:latest`. I ran into this and had to ask our AI friends for help. The correct image for Raspberry Pi is `vaultwarden/server:alpine`. Everything else, including where you store your data and which port you choose, is up to you.

I ran the container with `docker compose up -d` and checked logs with `docker logs -f vaultwarden`. This part is optional but helpful for catching errors.

This is also where I took a different path from most tutorials. Instead of using Caddy or Nginx Proxy Manager, I used Cloudflared because I already had a tunnel set up for my [NocoDB project](https://hughj.dev/nocodb). I learned a lot about Cloudflare Tunnels and wanted to stick with the same approach.

In my first project, I installed the Cloudflare Tunnel via the CLI. This time, I wanted to use the Cloudflare One Dashboard. My domain was already registered with Cloudflare, so I logged into Cloudflare One.

In the Zero Trust Platform, locate and click on "Networks".

Under Networks, go to “Manage Tunnels” and set up a tunnel if you do not already have one. It is pretty straightforward, so I will not go into too much detail here.

From here, you need to manage the routed hostnames as I have done here:

I just entered something as a demonstration, but a few things will happen automatically. Cloudflare will create a CNAME record in your DNS settings, and within a few seconds you will be able to navigate to your Vaultwarden instance.

This method works for almost anything running on a port on your machine. I prefer it over opening ports on my router, which can introduce security risks. Cloudflare Tunnels create an outbound-only connection from your device to Cloudflare and rely on their global network to handle the rest.

I will create another post soon about generating the keys needed to securely enable the Admin page.
